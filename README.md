# Pulseshaping-tutorial
This repository hosts the source files for an interactive tutorial on pulse-shaping of few-femtosecond pulses. The actual tutorial is hosted here:

https://rawgit.com/azazeus/Pulseshaping-tutorial/master/pulse-shaping-part1.html

The tutorial uses a javascript numerical computation library called [numericjs](https://github.com/sloisel/numeric/) written by SÃ©bastien Loisel for performing the necessary numerical calculations for the user-interactive parts. 

In [Part 1](https://rawgit.com/azazeus/Pulseshaping-tutorial/master/), the user can change the strengths of different orders of optical dispersion to see the effect on a short pulse from a modelocked laser. In [Part 2](https://rawgit.com/azazeus/Pulseshaping-tutorial/master/pulse-shaping-part2.html), the user can play with imparting a spectral pattern on the ultrashort pulse to change its two-photon excitation potential. The visualizations in this tutorial have been written in [d3.js](https://www.d3.js), while the equations are beautifully rendered by [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/). Enjoy!
